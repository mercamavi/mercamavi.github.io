            <p> I am a CompTIA Network +, Security + Certified Electronic Engineer Transitioning from
                a career in the Telecommunication Industry and seeking a full-time role in the field of Cybersecurity.
                Recently completed the Google cybersecurity certificate where I got valuable experience using SQL,
                Python
                and tools like Wireshark, Suricata and SIEM tools to get insight from data traffic and security logs.
                This experience combined with detail-oriented skills and security mindset will help me to efficiently
                identify threats,
                risk and vulnerabilities to protect organization and peopleâ€™s data assets.</p>
