                <p> I am a CompTIA Network +, Security + Certified Electronic Engineer Transitioning from
                    a career in the Telecommunication Industry and seeking a full-time role in the field of
                    Cybersecurity.
                    Recently completed the Google cybersecurity certificate where I got valuable experience using SQL,
                    Python
                    and tools like Wireshark, Suricata and SIEM tools to get insight from data traffic and security
                    logs.
                    This experience combined with detail-oriented skills and security mindset will help me to
                    efficiently
                    identify threats,
                    risk and vulnerabilities to protect organization and peopleâ€™s data assets.</p>

                        <p> In this project I perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share
                            company helping her to get more customers.
                            I follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask,Prepare,Process,
                            Analyze, Share and Act using R language.

                        <p> In this research I used several algorithms of Machine Learning classification
                            method to predict the type of enzime into six major knowns classess. Then I
                            evaluate the perfomance of each one and changes some features to determinate
                            if it can be improved. It was developed with Python.
