        <h1>Hello, </h1>
        <p> My name is Amaury, thank you for
            taking your time to know about me.
        </p>
        <p> I am a CompTIA Network +, Security + Certified Electronic Engineer Transitioning from
            a career in the Telecommunication Industry and seeking a full-time role in the field of Cybersecurity.
            Recently completed the Google cybersecurity certificate where I got valuable experience using SQL, Python
            and tools like Wireshark, Suricata and SIEM tools to get insight from data traffic and security logs.
            This experience combined with detail-oriented skills and security mindset will help me to efficiently
            identify threats,
            risk and vulnerabilities to protect organization and peopleâ€™s data assets.</p>
